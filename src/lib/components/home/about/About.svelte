		<p>I'm Kabir Asani. I'm an entrepreneur, developer, content creator, and experimentalist.</p>

		<p>
			While professionally specialised in minimalist, aesthetic and functional experiences, I extend
			these principles to my personal life and beyond.
		</p>

		<p>
			With a degree in Computer Science, I started in an early-age startup and grew into senior
			roles at various tech companies thereafter.
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm now on my entrepreneurial journey, whilst creating content with an aim and intent to give
			back to the society.
